# RiotSharp

[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/RiotSharp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/RiotSharp) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/2gbc0e50jeei2nuw/branch/develop?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/BenFradet/riotsharp/branch/develop) [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/benfradet/riotsharp.png?label=Ready)](https://waffle.io/benfradet/riotsharp)

C# Wrapper for the [Riot Games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/)

##Features

- No need to worry about the 10 requests per 10s or the 500 requests per 10m rate limits, they are already implemented in the wrapper
- LINQ support
- Synchronous and asynchronous API
- Caching for the Static API

##Installation

Install RiotSharp through NuGet:
```
PM> Install-Package RiotSharp
```

or

1. Clone the repo (https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp.git) or [download the zip file](https://github.com/BenFradet/RiotSharp/archive/master.zip).

2. Build the RiotSharp project and add the library to your own application.

##Usage

###Game API
In order to use the api you need an api key which you can get [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Entry point to the api if you do not own a production API key:
```c#
var api = RiotApi.GetInstance("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

If you do own a production API key you can specify your own rate limits:
```c#
var api = RiotApi.GetInstance("YOUR_API_KEY",
  yourRateLimitPer10s, yourRateLimitPer10m);
```

To get a summoner:
```c#
try
{
  var summoner = api.GetSummoner(Region.euw, "StopOFlop");
}
catch (RiotSharpException ex)
{
  // Handle the exception however you want.
}
```

To get the stats in ranked for a specific champion for this summoner:
```c#
try
{
  var varusRanked = summoner.GetStatsRanked(Season.Season3)
    .Where((s) => s.Name != null && s.Name.Equals("Varus"))
    .FirstOrDefault();
}
catch (RiotSharpException ex)
{
  // Handle the exception however you want.
}

foreach (var stat in varusRanked.Stats)
{
  Console.WriteLine(stat.Name + "  " + stat.Value);
}
```

###Tournament API

You first have to apply for a tournament API key [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Entry point for the tournament API:
```c#
var tournamentApi = TournamentRiotApi.GetInstance("TOURNAMENT_API_KEY");
```

Next up, create a provider.
The url will will receive callbacks callbacks with match results.
```c#
var provider = api.CreateProvider(region, url);
```

And create a tournament:
```c#
var tournament = api.CreateTournament(provider.Id, "TOURNAMENT_NAME");
```

Now you can create tournament codes (which you can use to join games):
```c#
var tournamentCode = api.CreateTournamentCode(tournament.Id, teamSize, allowedSummonerIds,
    TournamentSpectatorType.All, TournamentPickType.TournamentDraft,
    TournamentMapType.SummonnersRift, string.Empty);
```
The tournament code can now be entered in the client to join a game with the specified settings.

##Contribution

Simply send a pull request!

When adding new features, please provide the related unit tests within the pull request.
To run the unit tests you need to modify the [App.config](RiotSharpTest/App.config) file and fill out the appropriate values so the tests can run.

Moreover, the documentation is far from perfect so every bit of help is more than welcome.
